"""
Given an undirected graph containing n nodes labeled from 0 to nâˆ’1, determine whether the graph is a valid tree or not.
Return TRUE if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and FALSE otherwise.

A graph is a valid tree when all the nodes are connected and there is no cycle between them.

To check if the graph is a valid tree, we start from the first node and move to adjacent nodes using a depth-first
search. We mark visited nodes and look for cycles by checking if a node has been visited before. If we encounter a
previously visited node that is not the parent, we have found a cycle, indicating the graph is not a tree. If the
depth-first search started from the first node is complete, but some nodes remain unvisited, the graph is not connected,
making it not a tree. If all nodes have been visited and no cycles are found, the graph is a valid tree.

The following are the steps of the algorithm:

-Initialize a visited list to keep track of nodes that will be visited during the traversal of the graph.

-Starting from the first node, start traversing the graph.

-While traversing the adjacent nodes in the graph, mark the current node as visited in the visited list.

-Pick a node and check if the node has been visited before.

    -If a node has not been visited before, continue the traversal from this node.

    -Otherwise, if the node has been visited before a cycle has been found. Return FALSE.

After completing the depth-first search, traverse the visited list and check if the value of any index is FALSE; it
means the graph is disconnected, return FALSE. Otherwise, if all values are TRUE, return TRUE, indicating the graph is
a tree.


The time complexity of this solution is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices in the graph and E is the number of
edges in the graph. This is because the whole graph is traversed once.

### Maintain a copy of visited array. while performing DFs, if all nodes are visited from a node, that means all nodes
can be connected. While performing DFs, check for a cycle as well.
