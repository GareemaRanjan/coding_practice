"""
Implement a function sort_binary_list(lst) that takes a binary list of numbers and returns a sorted list.

Input
A list having binary numbers

Output
A sorted binary list

Sample input
lst = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Sample output
result = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Solution
Thereâ€™s nothing tricky going on here. We are pushing all ones towards the right and all the zeros towards the left. For
this, we have maintained two variables i and j. The index i moves forward in the list and finds out if the element at
index i is zero. If it is, it swaps it with the element at index j. Index j is keeping track of the last position where
we have placed our last zero element in the list. As soon as we swap, we move the index j ahead to the next index, where
zero can be placed in the next swap.

Time complexity
Since the list is iterated only once, the time complexity is O(n).
