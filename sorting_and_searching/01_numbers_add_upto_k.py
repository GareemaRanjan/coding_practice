"""
In this problem, you have to implement the find_sum(lst, n) function which will take a list lst and number n as inputs
and return two numbers from the list that add up to n.

Input
A list and a number n

Output
A list with two integers a and b that add up to n

Solution
For each element in the list, use a binary search to look for the difference between that element and the intended sum.
You can implement the binary_search function however you like, recursively or iteratively. So, if the intended sum is n
and the first element of the sorted list is a0, then you will conduct a binary search for n-a0 and so on for every a,
i.e., an until one is found.

Time complexity
Since most popular sorting functions take O(nlogn), letâ€™s assume the built-in function in Python,.sort() function
takes the same. Then, a binary search for each element takes O(logn), so a binary search for all n elements will take
O(nlogn). So, the overall time complexity is O(nlogn).
